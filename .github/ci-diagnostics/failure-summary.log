Partial workflow run analysis (note: API returned 30 of 1412 total runs):

Summary:
- validate-workflows: recurring failures across many pull_request runs. Likely YAML/schema/linter errors.
- .github/workflows/ci-rewrite.yml: failing on push events; investigate secrets, permissions, or step errors.
- Smoke tests (non-E2E): intermittent failures; likely flaky tests or environment/dependency issues.

Recommended next steps for Copilot analysis:
- Inspect validate-workflows failing run logs to identify the exact YAML/file/line causing lint/schema failure.
- Open ci-rewrite failing run logs and capture failing step and error trace (check secrets and permissions).
- For Smoke tests failures, capture specific test failures and traceback; consider adding retries or pinning dependencies.
