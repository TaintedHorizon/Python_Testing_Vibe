# Legacy Code & Naming Standardization (Relocated)

The full, maintained version of this document now lives at:

`doc_processor/docs/LEGACY_CODE.md`

Rationale for relocation:
- Consolidate all processor-specific docs under `doc_processor/docs/`
- Reduce noise in repository root
- Make scope boundaries clearer for assistants & contributors

If you intended to edit legacy handling policies, open the relocated file instead.

Relocation updates:
- October 2025: Monolithic backups moved to `archive/app_backups/` with stub headers.
- October 2025: Script-based workflow demo moved to `doc_processor/dev_tools/manual_tests/`.

Last relocation update: October 2025
