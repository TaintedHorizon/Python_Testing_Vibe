## Quick Start

## Documentation

For detailed subsystem and workflow documentation:

- **Docs Index:** [`doc_processor/docs/README.md`](doc_processor/docs/README.md)
- **Usage Guide:** [`doc_processor/docs/USAGE.md`](doc_processor/docs/USAGE.md)
- **Legacy / Deprecation Policy:** [`doc_processor/docs/LEGACY_CODE.md`](doc_processor/docs/LEGACY_CODE.md)
- **AI / LLM Detection Details:** [`doc_processor/docs/LLM_DETECTION.md`](doc_processor/docs/LLM_DETECTION.md)
- **Deep Processor README:** [`doc_processor/readme.md`](doc_processor/readme.md)

All new deep-dive technical docs should live under `doc_processor/docs/` and be linked from the Docs Index.

### For Document Processing:
```bash
# 1) One-time environment setup
cd doc_processor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python dev_tools/database_setup.py
cp .env.sample .env  # Edit with your settings

# 2) Start the application (from repo root) ‚Äî REQUIRED
cd ..
./start_app.sh
```

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`.

Important:
- Always use `./start_app.sh`. It activates the correct venv and runs `python -m doc_processor.app` from the repo root.
- Don‚Äôt run `python app.py` or run from the `doc_processor/` subdirectory‚Äîimports will fail.
- Smart processing workflow lives under `Batch Control` ‚Üí ‚ÄúSmart Process‚Äù (streams progress and exposes cancel button when active).
 - FAST_TEST_MODE (set in `.env`) short-circuits heavy OCR & AI calls where possible to produce deterministic, fast test outcomes; rescan endpoint honors this mode.

#### Rescan Behavior (OCR / LLM)
Endpoint: `/api/rescan_document/<id>`

Modes:
- `llm_only`: Reuses stored OCR text, runs legacy simple classifier first (enables deterministic monkeypatching in tests) then optional structured classifier for confidence + reasoning.
- `ocr_and_llm`: Re-runs OCR (honoring logical rotation), persists updated text, then performs AI classification.
- `ocr`: Only refreshes OCR fields; AI suggestions untouched.

Filename Generation Logic:
- Regenerates when (a) no previous suggestion, (b) category changed but filename remained the same, or (c) OCR text content hash changed.
- In FAST_TEST_MODE, regeneration still occurs even with empty/mocked text‚Äîsupporting unit test determinism.
- Legacy-first ordering ensures monkeypatched `get_ai_classification` influences category and filename before structured classifier refinement.

Throttling:
- AI classification skipped if prior LLM rescan < 5 seconds ago (throttled flag returned).

Return Payload Highlights:
```
{
   "ai_category": "Invoice",
   "ai_filename": "2025_Invoice_Test",
   "updated": {"ocr": false, "ai": true},
   "throttled_ai": false
}
```

Planned Enhancements:
- Confidence reconciliation strategy when legacy and structured classifiers disagree.
- Optional override to force filename regeneration even if neither category nor hash changed.

## Rotation Handling & Testing

The system implements a two-tier rotation model:

1. Pre-OCR Normalization: Any persisted rotation override in `intake_rotations` is applied before OCR/searchable PDF generation so downstream AI & text extraction operate on correctly oriented pages.
2. Dynamic Serving Layer: The manipulation preview route (`/document/serve_single_pdf/<id>`) applies rotation on-the-fly (PyMuPDF) and caches the transformed PDF in `/tmp` keyed by `(doc_id, rotation)` with regeneration triggered when `updated_at` changes.

Safety & Performance Characteristics:
- Timestamp-Based Invalidation: Cached rotated PDFs are regenerated only when the corresponding rotation row‚Äôs `updated_at` advances.
- Double-Rotation Prevention: If the stored PDF‚Äôs first page already has a matching physical rotation, dynamic rotation is skipped (prevents 90¬∞ ‚Üí 180¬∞ compounding artifacts).
- Directory Whitelisting: Served paths validated against allowed roots (intake/processed/normalized/archive) to mitigate path traversal.

Test Coverage (New):
- `test_rotation_serving.py`: Validates cache regeneration when rotation angle changes.
- `test_grouped_rotation.py::test_grouped_document_rotation_serving`: Asserts grouped-document parity expectations using single-document route until a native grouped route is added.
- `test_grouped_rotation.py::test_no_double_rotation`: Ensures no byte changes when a physically rotated PDF matches declared rotation (cache reuse, no duplicate transform).
- `tests/conftest.py`: Provides reusable fixtures (`temp_db_path`, `app`, `client`, `seed_conn`) standardizing isolated ephemeral DB + app factory lifecycle.

Planned Enhancements:
- Dedicated grouped-document serving endpoint assembling multi-page PDFs with rotation normalization.
- Lightweight assertion test for pre-OCR normalization side-effects (e.g., verifying searchable text alignment vs rotation).
