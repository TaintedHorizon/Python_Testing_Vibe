# Python_Testing_Vibe

Recent changes (see `doc_processor/CHANGELOG.md` for full details):

Note: As of 2025-10-12 the `chore/db-backup-tests` branch includes a final lint pass and green unit tests (43 passed, 4 skipped). See changelog for details.

Update (2025-10-13): Local DB schema extensions and initialization added; the `database_setup.py` script now creates `document_tags`, `single_documents`, and `tag_usage_stats`. For local development the DB was initialized at `/home/svc-scan/db/documents.db`.

- Hardened database behavior: the application now protects against accidental
   creation or overwrite of repository-local SQLite files. Tests and local runs
   run against a temporary database unless explicitly allowed. A `DB_BACKUP_DIR`
   configuration option is respected for backing up database snapshots.
- Deterministic tests: pytest runs use an isolated temporary SQLite database and
   `FAST_TEST_MODE` to avoid heavy processing during tests. The export worker is
   executed inline in `FAST_TEST_MODE` to prevent timing/race issues in the
   test suite.
- Ollama (LLM) client behavior: the central LLM helper now prefers using the
   installed Python `ollama` client and passes `options.num_gpu` (derived from
   `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU`) to request CPU vs GPU execution. If the client fails or
   returns an invalid result, a robust HTTP fallback to `/api/generate` is used
   so different client/server versions are tolerated.
- Legacy scripts that instantiated `ollama.Client` directly were patched to
   honor `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU` so dev tools don't unintentionally force GPU usage.
- Integration test: an optional, skipped-by-default integration test
   (`doc_processor/tests/test_ollama_integration.py`) was added; enable it by
   setting `RUN_OLLAMA_INTEGRATION=1` to validate that `num_gpu=0` results in
   CPU execution on your Ollama host.

For development and running tests, see `doc_processor/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
and the `doc_processor/README.md` for project-specific startup instructions.

## End-to-end testing

This repository includes a Playwright-based end-to-end test suite that exercises the full GUI workflow (intake ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí smart processing ‚Üí manipulate ‚Üí export).

- E2E tests are located under `doc_processor/tests/e2e/` and use Playwright (Python) together with pytest.
- A fast in-process server-side test is available at `doc_processor/tests/test_gui_inprocess.py` for quicker verification without opening a browser.
- Tests are designed for deterministic runs; use the environment flags `FAST_TEST_MODE=1` and `SKIP_OLLAMA=1` during CI or local runs to avoid heavy OCR/LLM calls.

The GitHub Actions workflow for running the Playwright E2E tests is at `.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml`.

### CI & Playwright E2E ‚Äî recent work (2025-10-16)

Summary of the recent CI and end-to-end testing work performed to make Playwright E2E reliable and reproducible:

- Canonical GitHub Actions workflow: added `.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml` which starts the Flask app inside the job, waits for a health-check at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, and runs the Playwright tests in `ui_tests/`.
- Local reproduction helper: added `scripts/run_local_e2e.sh` ‚Äî a single script that reproduces the CI steps locally (creates/activates the `doc_processor/venv`, installs Python and Node deps, starts the Flask app, waits for the health-check, runs Playwright tests, and tears down). This lets you iterate without consuming GitHub Actions minutes.
- Deterministic Node installs: ensured `ui_tests/package.json` and `ui_tests/package-lock.json` are committed and in-sync so CI can use `npm ci` reliably. If you see `npm ci` complaining about lock mismatch, run `npm install` locally and commit the updated `package-lock.json`.
- Test and artifact fixes applied:
   - Replaced a corrupted Playwright test file (`ui_tests/e2e/intake_progress.spec.js`) with a clean, minimal test that runs under the Node Playwright runner.
   - Added `@playwright/test` to `ui_tests/package.json` so the Node test runner is installed in CI.
- Workflow hardening:
   - Ensured the workflow creates the `doc_processor/logs` directory before starting the app so `nohup` log redirection cannot fail.
   - Switched the runner to `ubuntu-22.04` in the workflow to ensure the Playwright system packages available via apt align with the runner image.
- PR & CI status: all changes have been pushed to branch `chore/clean-workflows-batch-pr` and are part of PR #15. We cancelled in-progress GitHub Actions runs to avoid extra billed minutes while iterating locally.

How to reproduce locally (short): use `./scripts/run_local_e2e.sh` from the repo root. It will:

1. Create/activate `doc_processor/venv` and install Python deps.
2. Install Playwright Python and attempt `python -m playwright install --with-deps`.
3. Run `npm ci` in `ui_tests/` (falls back to instructions if lockfile needs syncing).
4. Start the Flask app in background, wait for health-check, run `npx playwright test e2e`, and then tear down.

Notes & troubleshooting tips:
- If `npm ci` fails with a lockfile mismatch, run `npm install` locally and commit the updated `package-lock.json` before re-running locally or pushing to CI.
- If Playwright browser install fails due to missing OS packages, run `python -m playwright install --with-deps` locally (Linux users may need to install system packages via apt for their distro).
- For fast iteration prefer running `./scripts/run_local_e2e.sh` locally rather than triggering CI runs.

## Quick Start
To run the application locally and avoid accidental repository-local DB creation, follow these steps:

1. Create and activate the virtualenv in the `doc_processor/` directory:

```bash
cd doc_processor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. If you're starting the app in a development environment and don't have an existing DB, either:

- Explicitly allow DB creation (intentional):

```bash
export ALLOW_NEW_DB=1
```

- Or configure a backup-before-create location and choose backup behavior:

```bash
export DB_BACKUP_DIR=/var/lib/doc_processor/db_backups
export ALLOW_NEW_DB=backup
```

3. Start the app using the repository-provided startup script (this ensures the correct venv and environment are used):

```bash
./start_app.sh
```

Notes:
- For running tests and CI, use `FAST_TEST_MODE=1` and the test harness will create isolated temporary databases and skip heavy OCR/LLM work:

```bash
FAST_TEST_MODE=1 OLLAMA_NUM_GPU=0 pytest
```

- Avoid running `python -m doc_processor.app` directly in CI or test environments as it may start a long-lived dev server that interferes with test harnesses.


## Documentation

For detailed subsystem and workflow documentation:

- **Docs Index:** [`doc_processor/docs/README.md`](doc_processor/docs/README.md)
- **Usage Guide:** [`doc_processor/docs/USAGE.md`](doc_processor/docs/USAGE.md)
- **Legacy / Deprecation Policy:** [`doc_processor/docs/LEGACY_CODE.md`](doc_processor/docs/LEGACY_CODE.md)
- **AI / LLM Detection Details:** [`doc_processor/docs/LLM_DETECTION.md`](doc_processor/docs/LLM_DETECTION.md)
- **Deep Processor README:** [`doc_processor/readme.md`](doc_processor/readme.md)

All new deep-dive technical docs should live under `doc_processor/docs/` and be linked from the Docs Index.

### For Document Processing:
```bash
# 1) One-time environment setup
cd doc_processor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python dev_tools/database_setup.py
cp .env.sample .env  # Edit with your settings

# 2) Start the application (from repo root) ‚Äî REQUIRED
cd ..
./start_app.sh
```

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`.

Important:
- Always use `./start_app.sh`. It activates the correct venv and runs `python -m doc_processor.app` from the repo root.
- Don‚Äôt run `python app.py` or run from the `doc_processor/` subdirectory‚Äîimports will fail.
- Smart processing workflow lives under `Batch Control` ‚Üí ‚ÄúSmart Process‚Äù (streams progress and exposes cancel button when active).
 - FAST_TEST_MODE (set in `.env`) short-circuits heavy OCR & AI calls where possible to produce deterministic, fast test outcomes; rescan endpoint honors this mode.

Database backups and retention
-----------------------------

This project keeps a separate, configurable directory for database backups and original-file retention so those artifacts are not accidentally committed into the repository.

- Default location: the app will use an XDG-friendly path under the current user's data directory, e.g. `~/.local/share/doc_processor/db_backups` when `DB_BACKUP_DIR` is not set.
- Override: set `DB_BACKUP_DIR` in `doc_processor/.env` (or your environment) to an absolute path outside the repo. Example:

```ini
# doc_processor/.env
DB_BACKUP_DIR=/var/lib/doc_processor/db_backups
```

- Rationale: keeping backups outside the repo prevents accidental commits of binary SQLite files and makes retention/cleanup policies explicit. Tests and dev tools in this repository are adjusted to honor `DB_BACKUP_DIR` and use temporary databases unless explicitly configured otherwise.


Batch guard and testing notes
----------------------------

- A centralized batch-creation guard now lives in `doc_processor/batch_guard.py`. Production hot-paths use `get_or_create_processing_batch()` and `create_new_batch()` to avoid duplicate/phantom batches under concurrent requests. This makes smart processing and "Start New Batch" behavior deterministic.

- To run the full test suite locally (recommended before pushing changes):
```bash
cd doc_processor
source venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
```


#### Rescan Behavior (OCR / LLM)
Endpoint: `/api/rescan_document/<id>`

Modes:
- `llm_only`: Reuses stored OCR text, runs legacy simple classifier first (enables deterministic monkeypatching in tests) then optional structured classifier for confidence + reasoning.
- `ocr_and_llm`: Re-runs OCR (honoring logical rotation), persists updated text, then performs AI classification.
- `ocr`: Only refreshes OCR fields; AI suggestions untouched.

Filename Generation Logic:
- Regenerates when (a) no previous suggestion, (b) category changed but filename remained the same, or (c) OCR text content hash changed.
- In FAST_TEST_MODE, regeneration still occurs even with empty/mocked text‚Äîsupporting unit test determinism.
- Legacy-first ordering ensures monkeypatched `get_ai_classification` influences category and filename before structured classifier refinement.

Throttling:
- AI classification skipped if prior LLM rescan < 5 seconds ago (throttled flag returned).

Return Payload Highlights:
```
{
   "ai_category": "Invoice",
   "ai_filename": "2025_Invoice_Test",
   "updated": {"ocr": false, "ai": true},
   "throttled_ai": false
}
```

Planned Enhancements:
- Confidence reconciliation strategy when legacy and structured classifiers disagree.
- Optional override to force filename regeneration even if neither category nor hash changed.

## Rotation Handling & Testing

The system implements a two-tier rotation model:

1. Pre-OCR Normalization: Any persisted rotation override in `intake_rotations` is applied before OCR/searchable PDF generation so downstream AI & text extraction operate on correctly oriented pages.
2. Dynamic Serving Layer: The manipulation preview route (`/document/serve_single_pdf/<id>`) applies rotation on-the-fly (PyMuPDF) and caches the transformed PDF in `/tmp` keyed by `(doc_id, rotation)` with regeneration triggered when `updated_at` changes.

Safety & Performance Characteristics:
- Timestamp-Based Invalidation: Cached rotated PDFs are regenerated only when the corresponding rotation row‚Äôs `updated_at` advances.
- Double-Rotation Prevention: If the stored PDF‚Äôs first page already has a matching physical rotation, dynamic rotation is skipped (prevents 90¬∞ ‚Üí 180¬∞ compounding artifacts).
- Directory Whitelisting: Served paths validated against allowed roots (intake/processed/normalized/archive) to mitigate path traversal.

Test Coverage (New):
- `test_rotation_serving.py`: Validates cache regeneration when rotation angle changes.
- `test_grouped_rotation.py::test_grouped_document_rotation_serving`: Asserts grouped-document parity expectations using single-document route until a native grouped route is added.
- `test_grouped_rotation.py::test_no_double_rotation`: Ensures no byte changes when a physically rotated PDF matches declared rotation (cache reuse, no duplicate transform).
- `tests/conftest.py`: Provides reusable fixtures (`temp_db_path`, `app`, `client`, `seed_conn`) standardizing isolated ephemeral DB + app factory lifecycle.

Planned Enhancements:
- Dedicated grouped-document serving endpoint assembling multi-page PDFs with rotation normalization.
- Lightweight assertion test for pre-OCR normalization side-effects (e.g., verifying searchable text alignment vs rotation).
