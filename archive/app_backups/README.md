This directory stores historical monolithic/legacy application entrypoints preserved only for reference.

Files:
- app_monolithic_backup.py (pre-blueprint monolith)
- app_original_backup.py (earlier iteration; largely duplicate)

Status: DO NOT IMPORT IN PRODUCTION. Modern app lives at doc_processor/app.py and blueprint routes.

Removal criteria: Once no longer needed for historical diff context, delete both.
