# --- Gemini API Configuration ---
# API_URL: The specific endpoint for the Gemini model you want to use.

# --- Application Settings ---
# General operational settings for the script.

# DRY_RUN: If set to True, the script will log the actions it would have taken
# (like moving files or calling the API) without actually performing them. This is useful for testing.
# **ACTION**: Set to False for normal operation.

# --- Directory Configuration ---
# Defines the file paths for intake, processing, and archiving.
# **ACTION**: Update these paths to match the locations on your system.

# Example: "/home/user/scans/intake" or "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Scans\\Intake"

# PROCESSED_DIR: The root folder where categorized documents will be saved.
# Subdirectories for each category will be created here automatically.
# Example: "/home/user/scans/processed" or "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Scans\\Processed"

# --- Category Configuration ---
# Defines the document categories and their corresponding subfolder names.
# The keys are the category names the AI will be instructed to use.
# The values are the directory paths (relative to PROCESSED_DIR) where the files will be saved.
# You can add, remove, or change categories to fit your needs.

# --- Logging Configuration ---
# Settings for how the script records its activities.

# - INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected (recommended for normal use).
# - WARNING: Indicates an unexpected event that doesn't stop the program.
# - ERROR: A serious problem that prevented a specific task from completing.
# - CRITICAL: A very serious error that may cause the entire program to stop.
