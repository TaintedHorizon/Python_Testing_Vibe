Smoke run 18858633130 summary

- Workflow: Smoke tests (non-E2E)
- Branch: test/wheelhouse-smoke
- Event: pull_request
- Key outcomes:
  - FAST_TEST_MODE/CI_SKIP_HEAVY_IMPORTS were set for collection and persistently unset before runtime.
  - Numpy was installed (numpy==1.26.4) for collection.
  - The workflow downloaded the wheelhouse artifact from heavy-deps run 18854584211 (artifact id 4386420714) and unpacked wheelhouse-3.11.tgz.
  - requirements-ci.txt was installed (Pillow, PyMuPDF, Flask, etc.).
  - Heavy deps installed from ./.wheelhouse where available; missing items fell back to PyPI (pytesseract was installed from PyPI during the job).
  - Pytest executed non-e2e tests; run completed without ModuleNotFoundError for pytesseract or Pillow.

See actions run: https://github.com/TaintedHorizon/Python_Testing_Vibe/actions/runs/18858633130

Notes:
- Next recommended step: keep `pytesseract` in `requirements-ci.txt` (done), consider documenting wheelhouse creation and fallback policy in `docs/ci-heavy-deps.md`.
