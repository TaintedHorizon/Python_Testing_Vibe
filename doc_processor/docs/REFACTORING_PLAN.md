# Flask App Refactoring Plan

## ðŸš¨ Current Problem
- **app.py is 2947 lines** with 68 functions and 60 routes
- Too large to edit safely - prone to indentation/syntax errors
- Difficult to maintain, debug, and understand
- Single point of failure for entire application

## ðŸŽ¯ Proposed Solution: Modular Architecture

### 1. **Core Application Structure**
```
doc_processor/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py (main app factory - ~100 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ intake.py          # Intake analysis routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ batch.py           # Batch control and management  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manipulation.py    # Document manipulation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ export.py          # Export and finalization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py           # Admin and category management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api.py             # API endpoints and SSE
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ batch_service.py   # Batch business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ document_service.py # Document operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ category_service.py # Category management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ export_service.py  # Export operations
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py         # Utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ decorators.py      # Custom decorators
â””â”€â”€ (existing files...)
```

### 2. **Benefits of Refactoring**
- âœ… **Smaller files** - easier to edit without errors
- âœ… **Clear separation** - each file has single responsibility  
- âœ… **Reduced conflicts** - multiple people can work on different areas
- âœ… **Better testing** - easier to unit test individual components
- âœ… **Improved maintainability** - find and fix issues faster
- âœ… **Future-proof** - easier to add new features

### 3. **Migration Strategy**
1. **Phase 1**: Extract route groups into blueprints
2. **Phase 2**: Move business logic to service classes  
3. **Phase 3**: Extract utility functions
4. **Phase 4**: Create proper application factory pattern

### 4. **File Size Targets**
- Main `app.py`: ~100 lines (app factory + config)
- Route files: ~200-400 lines each
- Service files: ~300-500 lines each
- No single file over 600 lines

### 5. **Immediate Actions**
1. Create route blueprints for major sections
2. Extract helper functions to utils
3. Move database operations to services
4. Update imports and test functionality

## ðŸš€ Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Intake, Batch, Export routes (most used)
2. **Medium Priority**: Manipulation, Admin routes  
3. **Low Priority**: API endpoints (working well currently)

This refactoring will solve the editing problems and make the codebase much more maintainable!
