# Heavy dependencies for wheelhouse generation
# Put packages here that are expensive or platform-specific (torch, triton, xformers, etc.)
# NOTE: Many of these require platform-specific wheels (CUDA variants) or additional index URLs.
# Example entries (uncomment and pin as needed for your platform):
# torch==2.2.0+cu118
# triton==2.0.0
# xformers==0.0.16
# fairscale==0.4.13
# faiss-cpu==1.7.3

# Add other heavy, slow-to-install packages below.
# For CI verification only: include a small, fast package so the wheelhouse isn't empty.
# Remove or replace this with real heavy packages (torch, triton) for production wheelhouse builds.
requests==2.31.0
numpy==1.26.4
