# Heavy dependencies for wheelhouse generation
# Put packages here that are expensive or platform-specific (torch, triton, xformers, etc.)
# NOTE: Many of these require platform-specific wheels (CUDA variants) or additional index URLs.
# Example entries (uncomment and pin as needed for your platform):
# torch==2.2.0+cu118
# triton==2.0.0
# xformers==0.0.16
