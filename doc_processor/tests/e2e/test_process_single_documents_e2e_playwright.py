    """End-to-end scaffold using Playwright (skip by default).

    This test is a runnable scaffold. It expects Playwright (Python) and browsers
    installed and that `./start_app.sh` can launch the app in the repository root.

    Steps (manual/automated):
    1. Ensure `doc_processor/tests/fixtures/sample_small.pdf` exists in the intake dir
       or copy it there before running the test.
    2. Set environment variable PLAYWRIGHT_E2E=1 to enable.
    3. Install Playwright for Python and browsers (see README below).
    4. Run pytest -q doc_processor/tests/e2e/test_process_single_documents_e2e_playwright.py

    The implementation here is intentionally lightweight and acts as a checklist for
    a full Playwright implementation. It currently asserts True to avoid accidental
    failures in environments that don't have Playwright installed.

    # TODO: Full implementation â€” interact with the UI via Playwright:
    # - Start app: ./start_app.sh (background)
    # - Navigate to /intake/analyze_intake
    # - Click Start Analysis and wait for analysis to complete
    # - Click Start Smart Processing and wait for SSE stream to complete
    # - Navigate to /batch/audit/<batch_id> or /batch/control and assert document row present
    # This scaffold keeps the test repository tidy and documents the exact UX flow.
