    # 1. Start the app in background (./start_app.sh)
    # 2. Launch Playwright, open http://127.0.0.1:5000/batch/control
    # 3. Click the start-batch button, upload or ensure sample file in intake
    # 4. Trigger process_smart via UI, wait for preview element to appear
    # 5. Assert DOM contains expected document filename or preview iframe
    # Note: Implementation deferred until we enable Playwright and CI resources.
