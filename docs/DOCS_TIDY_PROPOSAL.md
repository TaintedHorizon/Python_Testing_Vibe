# Docs Tidy / .github README updates

This PR proposes a small documentation tidy that:

- Adds a link to `docs/SRS.md` from `.github/README.md` (so CI and workflow docs reference requirements)
- Adds a short `CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md` with instructions to run `validate-workflows` locally and how to add workflows to `archive/`.
- Adds a checklist for archive PRs (owner, reason, rollback note).

This PR will be small, docs-only, and intended to be merged quickly to improve discoverability.

Proposed files in follow-up PRs:
- `.github/OWNERS.md` (list workflow owners)
- `.github/archive/README.md` (why items are archived)
