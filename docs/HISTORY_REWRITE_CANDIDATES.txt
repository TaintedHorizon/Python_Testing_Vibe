Found the following large blobs:
     1	7461d59d6e457f2502bf015395334e3808bb1a0f 83152330 Document_Scanner_Ollama_outdated/model_cache/craft_mlt_25k.pth

Suggested actions:
1) Remove by size (recommended)
   git clone --mirror <repo-url> repo-rewrite.git
   cd repo-rewrite.git
   git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 50M

2) Remove by path (if any specific path is listed below, add one --path line per path)

Paths that appear in the above blobs (candidate paths will be printed):
Document_Scanner_Ollama_outdated/model_cache/craft_mlt_25k.pth  ->  7461d59d6e457f2502bf015395334e3808bb1a0f

If you want me to prepare a filter-repo command that removes specific paths, re-run this script with the same threshold and then edit the produced docs/HISTORY_REWRITE_CANDIDATES.txt to include the exact --path lines you want removed. I will not perform any rewrite.
