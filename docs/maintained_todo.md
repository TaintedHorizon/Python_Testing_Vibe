# Maintained TODO (mirror of managed task list)

This file mirrors the authoritative, managed todo list used by the developer assistant.
Primary source: the workspace task manager (used by the automation agent). This file is a human-readable mirror so maintainers can see goals in the repo.

Update practice:
- The authoritative list is the managed todo store (not this file). When major status changes occur, update this file to keep the repo mirror in sync.
- Do not edit this file to change statuses unless you also update the managed todo store through the agent or tooling.

## Goals and tracked items

1. Stabilize CI workflows (in-progress)
   - Make GitHub Actions reliably run across branches and PRs.
   - Fix smoke / heavy-deps / manylinux parsing bugs and ensure guard env vars are handled properly.
   - Acceptance: smoke and heavy-deps workflows run end-to-end; heavy-deps uploads `wheelhouse-3.11.tgz`; smoke can download it when PR labeled.

2. Fetch & validate wheelhouse artifacts (in-progress)
   - Use `scripts/ci/fetch_wheelhouse_poll.sh` (or improved parser) to fetch artifacts.
   - Validate critical wheels: numpy, pytesseract, Pillow.
   - Acceptance: `ci_artifacts/run-*/list/` contains `tar_contents.txt`, `whl_files.txt`, `critical_wheels.txt`.

3. Run smoke job with wheelhouse (not-started)
   - Label PR `run-heavy-deps`, trigger smoke workflow, and verify minimal pytest run installs from `doc_processor/.wheelhouse`.

4. Implement manylinux builds (in-progress)
   - Provide opt-in manylinux builds (cibuildwheel) for missing binary wheels.

5. Security audit & cleanup (completed)
   - Remove/redact committed CI/test artifacts containing token-like strings and add `.gitignore` entries.

6. Ensure doc_processor end-to-end automated tests (in-progress)
   - Add fast, reproducible E2E smoke tests in CI using `TEST_TMPDIR` and the wheelhouse approach.

7. Clean up repository artifacts and history (not-started)
   - Remove large binary artifacts from history and untrack CI artifact folders as needed.

8. Archive proven wheelhouses (not-started)
   - Store validated wheelhouse tarballs and short manifests in `docs/ci-archive/` with checksums.

9. Persist TODO in repo (mirror) (completed)
   - This file is the repo mirror. The primary, editable todo is the managed todo store.

10. PR review & merge readiness (not-started)
   - Complete PR #34 checklist: run heavy-deps artifact, label smoke, run tests, gather logs, request review.

If you want the agent to update this file automatically when statuses change, say "sync todo mirror" and the agent will update this file from the managed todo store on demand.

Maintainer note: prefer the managed todo store for programmatic updates; this file is a convenience mirror for reviewers and offline browsing.
