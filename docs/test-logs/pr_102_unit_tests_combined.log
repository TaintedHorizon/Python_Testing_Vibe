Notes:
- No failing tests observed in the two unit-test job logs attached to PR #102.
- Warnings observed (examples):
  - DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence '\s' in `tests/e2e/test_process_single_documents_playwright_full.py`
  - Deprecation/Style warnings referencing use of `datetime.utcnow()` in `doc_processor/batch_guard.py` and `doc_processor/database.py` (consider switching to timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` where appropriate).

Recommended next steps for reviewers:
1) Inspect the full raw logs via the attached Gist (linked above) for any environment or install anomalies.
2) If reviewers want the complete raw logs in-repo, I can push them under `docs/test-logs/` (currently added a compact summary file).
3) If you prefer direct tracebacks for specific flaky reproductions, tell me which run(s) and I will paste the relevant tracebacks into the PR comment.

Context: These logs were produced after applying the DB-level mitigation for duplicate-batch creation and local reproducer/instrumentation. The unit-test jobs attached to PR #102 show no failing tests in these runs; CI Basic checks previously failed on lint/syntax and were fixed in follow-up commits.

File created by automation to provide an easily discoverable, in-repo pointer to unit-test artifacts for PR #102.
